Laurel Hillâ€™s Pre-K program is specifically designed for children who would benefit socially or physically by deferring kindergarten entrance. The program is located in a classroom built especially for the Pre-K in 1994. The ratio of adults to children in the Pre-K program is 1 to 5.

Children in the Pre-K program participate in learning activities and projects over extended periods of time. Special attention is paid to physical development, as well as acquisition of kindergarten readiness skills
