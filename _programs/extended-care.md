## Extended Care is available from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM 

Laurel Hill offers flexible hours of care for families who might need it. Families who use the option of extended care (*) can bring their children in both before the AM program, or keep extended care into after the PM program hours. In addition, the PM program hours  can also be set as extended care, as space allows.

Extended care can be used occasionally or on a contracted basis, depending on the needs of the family. Contracted rates are considerably less expensive than the drop-in rates, as they allow for much easier scheduling for the school.

(*) Extended care is available as space allows. Please contact Molly at info@laurelhill.org for more information.
