## Extended Care is available from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM 

Families have the option to use extended care (*) if they need additional hours of childcare for an additional fee. These hours can include before and after the AM and PM programs, in addition to the regular program hours. 

Extended care can be used occasionally or on a contracted basis, depending on the needs of the family. Contracted rates are considerably less expensive than the drop-in rates, as they allow for much easier scheduling for the school.

(*) Extended care is available as space allows. Please contact Molly at info@laurelhill.org for more information.
