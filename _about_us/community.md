## Parent Education

The Parent Education Committee (PEC) at Laurel Hill is tasked with providing parenting support and community building opportunities as we grow our collective parenting knowledge together. Every school year, the PEC researches and facilitates 20-25 speakers and meetings covering a range of parenting topics including child development, discipline/connection strategies, and child health and safety issues. The four Core Philosophy meetings is an integral part of our program and led by the Laurel Hill staff.  Meetings typically take place weekday evenings throughout the semester. An adult from each family is required to attend seven Parent Education meetings per year, including four Core Philosophy meetings for new members.
