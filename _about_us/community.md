## We all work together to support each other.

This is to keep our school running and to help our children grow and learn. So, yes, it’s a lot of work, but that’s because it’s supposed to be, it’s important and that’s what being in a coop is all about.

### Parent Education

The Parent Education Committee (PEC) at Laurel Hill is tasked with providing parenting support and community building opportunities as we grow our collective parenting knowledge together. Every school year, the PEC researches and facilitates 20-25 speakers and meetings covering a range of parenting topics including child development, discipline/connection strategies, and child health and safety issues. The four Core Philosophy meetings is an integral part of our program and led by the Laurel Hill staff.  Meetings typically take place weekday evenings throughout the semester. An adult from each family is required to attend seven Parent Education meetings per year, including four Core Philosophy meetings for new members.


### Program Enrichment

Events are held and organized by the Program Enrichment Committee throughout the year. These events are designed to foster fun both outside and inside of school hours. Events such as art shows at local libraries, a Halloween party with activities and games, and a spring fair with a petting zoo are all enjoyed by staff, teachers, parents and children. In addition efforts are made to bring members of the community to share their talents with the children during school hours. Demonstrations have included baby washing, juggling, firetruck showcasing, and hair styling. These events showcase and nurture the unique community that is Laurel Hill.
