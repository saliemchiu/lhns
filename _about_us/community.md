## We all work together to support each other.

This is to keep our school running and to help our children grow and learn. So, yes, it’s a lot of work, but that’s because it’s supposed to be, it’s important and that’s what being in a coop is all about.

### Parent Education

The Parent Education Committee (PEC) at Laurel Hill is tasked with providing parenting support and community building opportunities as we grow our collective parenting knowledge together. Every school year, the PEC researches and facilitates 20-25 speakers and meetings covering a range of parenting topics including child development, discipline/connection strategies, and child health and safety issues. The four Core Philosophy meetings is an integral part of our program and led by the Laurel Hill staff.  Meetings typically take place weekday evenings throughout the semester. An adult from each family is required to attend seven Parent Education meetings per year, including four Core Philosophy meetings for new members.


### Program Enrichment

The Program Enrichment Committee’s job is to create a rich and memorable experience for children at LHNS. We do this by planning free social events for the students and their families such as the Halloween Party and the Spring Fair. We also bring onsite visitors to the school to provide our children with unique learning experiences offered by members of our community, from firemen to athletes, musicians to protectors of the environment, helping the children have a broader vision of their world and their role in it. Our committee is also responsible for the annual art show, featuring artwork from our students, displayed in public spaces such as the San Francisco Public Library.
