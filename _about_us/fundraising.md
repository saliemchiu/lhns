Fundraising is a vital part of the Laurel Hill community.The money we raise allows us to provide essential aspects of our program, including teacher salaries, art supplies, music classes, field trips, and scholarships for Laurel Hill families in need. Most importantly, it ensures that the young children in our community get a wonderful head start in developing a lifelong love of learning.

There are many ways to help. You can shop at a local merchant affiliated with eScrip; attend one of our many family-friendly fundraising events, such as our monthly Giorgio’s Pizza Night, our annual Pancake Breakfast, or our festive Holiday Faire in December. Our fabulous annual Spring Auction—the year’s biggest fundraiser—is a chance to bid on incredible auction items from art to vacations and dance the night away.

Thank you for your continued support!
