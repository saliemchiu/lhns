## Community

Community Fundraising reinforces our bond as a community through collaborative social events that provide financial support to the school. Events like our annual Pancake Breakfast and themed Dine Out Nights provide a way for families to converge and connect through food. Commercial programs like eScrip registration and the Sports Basement “Basementeer's Program” seamlessly integrates fundraising into busy parent schedules. Additionally, child-centered events like Winterfest, Trike-A-Thon, Memory Tiles, and Teacher Books create lasting memories and development opportunities that are the cornerstone of Laurel Hill pre-K education.  

## Auction

The Auction Fundraising Committee (AFC) provides funding support vital to academic and administrative operations including staff salaries, art supplies, music classes, field trips, and scholarships for families in need.  Every school year, the AFC coordinates and hosts The Spring Auction—an event focused on fundraising and celebrating our amazing and diverse community. Our current $100,000 annual goal is an ambitious and immense effort, but it is ultimately a “labor of love” that creates an incredible sense of ownership, comradery and fulfillment. We are party planners, cheerleaders, sellers and solicitors, but at our core, we are parents that believe in Laurel Hill and strive to provide our children with the best possible pre-school experience in San Francisco.
