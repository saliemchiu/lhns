## Laurel Hill traces its beginnings to Presidio Hill School, part of the 1920s cooperative school movement.  

Its curriculum is based largely upon the writings of John Dewey and other philosophers and educators involved with progressive educations. In the mid-1940s, the parents of Presidio Hill Open Air School (Grades K-8) recognized the value of the preschool experience for children, an idea that gained in popularity following WWII.


*1947*
Laurel Hill, originally known as Presidio Nursery School, is founded. It is dedicated "with the primary purpose to maintain a co-operative where children may obtain the highest type of progressive care and education and to promote and furnish adult education in parent-child relationships and nursery school operations." The first location is 80 Commonwealth Avenue.

A large scale fund-raising campaign is launched in order to purchase land and construct a building for the growing preschool. The three lots at 401 Euclid are partially donated by the Hallinan family.
