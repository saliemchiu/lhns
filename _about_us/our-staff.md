## Maria Chew - Director

Maria has been an educator and advocate for children and families for nearly 20 years. Starting her career as an elementary school teacher, reading specialist, and public school advocate, Maria’s educational philosophy came full-circle when her son started at Laurel Hill in 2001. Discovering the impact that a strong, supportive community had on her own family, Maria quickly recognized that a co-op provides a strong foundation for child development and growth; not only for a child’s future education but for that child’s entire life. She began teaching at Laurel Hill in 2001, served as the Interim Pre-K teacher in 2003, and most recently worked as the school’s Head Teacher. Maria is also a parent educator, working closely with Hand in Hand Parenting, a non-profit organization helping parents to nurture their connection with their children. As a parent at Laurel Hill, she has served as a Board Committee Chair for both the Parent Education and Fundraising Committees, and subsequently served as the Board President from 2008-2009. When Maria isn’t attending a Tuesday night meeting at Laurel Hill, you can usually find her spending time with her husband, Brian, sons, Dexter and Oliver, as well as her very large extended family.
 

## Molly Boyll - Office Manager/Admissions Coordinator

Molly Boyll was born and raised in New York City but has been living in San Francisco for almost 20 years. She has a degree in Theater Production and still loves to act and sing. She is an alumni parent and was the Enrollment Chair for three years, even though her daughter Caroline only attended LH for two! When not at Laurel Hill, she devotes her time to her family, trying out new recipes, and reading.


## Anne Randall - Curriculum Coordinator

Born and raised in Michigan, Anne came to San Francisco in 1981. Anne began her studies in Early Childhood Education in 1992 and came to Laurel Hill in 2002. A passionate advocate for children’s play, Anne loves the children’s innate sense of wonder and the thrill of their discoveries. In her spare time she loves music, art, nature, and baseball.


## Sally Silva - Teacher

Sally studied Early Childhood Education at Cabrillo College and taught preschool for four years before earning her B.A. in American Studies at U.C. Santa Cruz. She moved to San Francisco to study Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State and is currently working towards completing her Masters degree. In her spare time, Sally enjoys making clothes, going to rock shows, and singing karaoke.

## Collette Rowland - Teacher

Collette seems to get that seven-year itch when it comes to Laurel Hill. Her sons Flynn Beckman graduated in 1999 and Ike Beckman graduated in 2006. In 2012, Collette felt it was time to return — this time as a teacher! The oldest Beckman boy, Mack, was not a Laurel Hill grad, but somehow survived his parents’ inexperience, and grew into a beautiful young man.

Born in and raised in the Big Sky state of Montana, Collette has been a San Francisco resident since 1989. While her early career aspirations involved vague images of herself as an international businessperson, she worked in advertising, as a personal chef, and a tour guide. Finally, Collette figured out that teaching was really what she wanted to do when she grew up! Collette enjoys spending time with her family. She loves movies, to cook, bake, knit, travel, sew, read, walk and practice yoga. Her book club is composed of friends whose Laurel Hill grads turned 18 this year. (Note: something for you parents to look forward to!) She is so grateful that Laurel Hill is thriving, and plans to do her part to ensure that the love and power of this precious community continues for the sake of all the beautiful kids and their hard-working families.
