## Our staff team together with parents to provide an environment our children thrive under.

### Maria Chew, Director

Director **Maria Chew** has been an educator and an advocate for children and families for over 20 years. Starting her career as an elementary school teacher, reading specialist, and public school advocate, Maria’s educational philosophy came full circle when her son came to Laurel Hill in 2001. Discovering the impact that a strong, supportive community had on her own family, Maria quickly recognized that a co-op provides a strong foundation for child development and growth; not only for a child’s future education but for that child’s entire life. 

Along with supervising staff and advocating inside the school and out for the LHNS educational philosophy, Maria has served as a preschool teacher in Red Room and a Pre-K teacher in Purple Room, and enjoys working with our dedicated community of educators.  

When she isn't attending Tuesday night meetings you can usually find her spending time with her husband Brian, her sons Dexter and Oliver, and her very large extended family.  
 

### Molly Boyll, Office Manager &amp; Admissions Coordinator

**Molly Boyll** was born and raised in New York City but has been living in San Francisco for almost 20 years. She has a degree in Theater Production and still loves to act and sing. She is an alumni parent and was the Enrollment Chair for three years, even though her daughter Caroline only attended LH for two! When not at Laurel Hill, she devotes her time to her family, trying out new recipes, and reading.


### Anne Randall, Curriculum Coordinator

Born and raised in Michigan, Red Room Teacher and Curriculum Coordinator **Anne Randall** came to San Francisco in 1981. Anne began her studies in Early Childhood Education in 1992 and joined Laurel Hill in 2002, after developing a deep respect for play-based education and parent participation. 

A passionate advocate for children’s play, Anne loves the children’s innate sense of wonder and the thrill of their discoveries. 

In her spare time she loves music, art, nature, and baseball. 

### Sally Silva, Teacher

A native of California’s Central Valley, **Sally Silva** came to Laurel Hill in 2005. She studied Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University and American Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she began her career in Early Childhood Education teaching at a local preschool. She then pursued her certifications, earning her Teacher permit at Cabrillo College and her Director permit at San Francisco City College. 

She teaches in the AM and PM Preschool programs, and is a lover of travel, exercise, and rest in her time off.

### Collette Rowland, Teacher

**Collette Rowland's** relationship with Laurel Hill dates back nearly twenty years. Her sons Flynn and Ike Beckman graduated from LHNS in 1999 and 2006, and Collette returned to the school as a teacher in 2012. A Montana native, Collette has lived in San Francisco since 1989. Before recognizing that her true calling was in Early Childhood Education, she worked in advertising, as a personal chef, and as a tour guide. She is grateful that Laurel Hill continues to thrive, and is excited to help the momentum, love, and power of our unique community carry on into the future. 

When not at school, Collette enjoys cooking, baking, knitting, travel, sewing, reading, walking, practicing yoga, and spending time with her family and her many friends from her days as a parent at Laurel Hill.  


### Sabrina Mirzaie, Teacher

Pre-K teacher **Sabrina Mirzaie** joined Laurel Hill in 2015 after teaching at a Montessori preschool in San Francisco’s Sunset district for four years. She was born and raised in the Los Angeles area, but moved to San Francisco after graduating from UC Irvine with a degree in psychology and criminology. She has never had a job that did not involve working with children, from babysitting in middle school, working as a day camp counselor in high school, to teaching after college. 

In her free time, she enjoys fleeing the fog to visit her large family in sunny Burbank.


### Alyson Gembala, Teacher

**Alyson Gembala**, Yellow Room’s morning teacher, joined Laurel Hill in 2015. After receiving her BA from the University of Georgia, she taught with Teach for America for two years, falling in love with early childhood education. She later earned her Master’s degree from Teachers College, Columbia University, the first and largest graduate school of education in the United States. She taught in Georgia, Missippi, and New York before joining the LHNS staff.

She loves oobleck, dinosaur stomping, bubbles, and copious amounts of glitter, not necessarily all at once, but sometimes. Outside of school, she enjoys painting, reading, writing, and playing with her son-- a future LHNS student.

### Justin Volmert, Teacher

AM Blue Room teacher **Justin Volmert** has worked with children of all ages for many years, but was particularly drawn to early education by his experiences as a student and teacher at Stanford’s Bing Nursery School. After taking a quick break to pursue a legal career, he was delighted to return to an inspiring play-based school supported by an amazing community in 2015. 

He also coaches high school boys’ and girls’ tennis at the Urban School in San Francisco, and is an avid cyclist along with his partner Sarah.
