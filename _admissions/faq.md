## How does the enrollment process work for current/returning families?

At the end of November, Molly will contact all of our current families to find out who is returning next year and to which program. Families can choose from AM/PM Preschool or AM/PM PreK. Once we have our returning families in place, Molly will then go through the waitlist and begin the process of enrolling new students. We will also ask for a $100 deposit to hold at this point. The deposit will be applied to your August tuition. 

## PreK Enrollment

### What is PreK?

From our website: "Laurel Hill's Pre-K program was designed for children who would benefit socially or physically by deferring kindergarten entrance. The program is located in a beautiful, light-filled classroom built especially for the Pre-K in 1994. The ratio of adults to children in the Pre-K program is 1 to 5. It is typically a third year of preschool.""

Pre-K learning is still very much play based. The day lasts thirty minutes longer and children in the Pre-K program participate in learning activities and projects over extended periods of time. Special attention is paid to physical development, as well as acquisition of kindergarten readiness skills


### Is my child eligible for PreK?

To be eligible for Prek, a child needs to turn 5 between June and January 31.

### What if my child is not eligible for PreK?

Children not participating in PreK are welcome to join the Spring Bees in March. This program is designed for children moving on to Kindergarten without first going to Pre-K. The goal is to provide the children with developmentally appropriate, play-based opportunities to team together to work on project exploration. All children going to Kindergarten are eligible for the Summer PreK program, held the first three weeks of June.


### These enrollment dates seem arbitrary and don’t work for our family. How were they established?

When PreK was developed, it was intended to be a Kindergarten deferment year. At that time children needed to turn 5 before December 2 to be in PreK, which aligned with Kindergarten enrollment. Over the years the state has rolled back its K start dates to September, and more and more people want the prek experience. Through trial and error we have settled on the current date, turning 5 by January 31st as being the most developmentally appropriate age group for our program. We have consistently found that younger children in PreK have difficulty adjusting to the group and its projects.

Whether the cut off date is September, December or January, the nature of cut off dates always leaves someone behind. Children who are not age eligible for PreK are welcome to visit the PreK program during visiting time.

### Prek? Spring Bees? I thought this school was play based!

Giving children time learn through play is the best way to prepare children for Kindergarten. they’ll have plenty of time for formal academic learning in the years to come. Generally, children about to go off to Kindergarten enjoy the Spring Bees experience. A child not wanting to attend  or not enjoying Spring Bees is signalling to us that their time is better spent learning through play. If you would prefer that your child not participate in Spring Bees or PreK, just let us know.

## Siblings ????

### Our younger child is SOOOOO ready to be at Laurel Hill. Will they be able to start in January?

When we enroll children for the fall, we fill the school to capacity. If space opens up between September and January, we will occasionally fill spots in January with siblings or alum families. This is only done if space is available and by order of application received. Please don’t count on being enrolled in January.

### How old does child need to be for preschool eligibility?

Children need to be 2 years, 9 months when they start school. This typically means that the child needs to be three by November 15th. Children also need to be potty trained.
