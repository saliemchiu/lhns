## As a cooperative school, Laurel Hill depends on the support of its parent and caregiver community. 

Cooperative families are a self-selected group. Our families' dedication to the school is an extension of the dedication they have for their children. At Laurel Hill, you not only get to see your child in action you get to learn from a wide variety of other parents. It’s inspiring to see how many people are willing to go beyond what’s required and to feel empowered by pitching in. 

The following table outlines the required parent participation as members of the Laurel Hill community.
