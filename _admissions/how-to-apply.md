## Admissions Criteria

Preferential admission priority is given to current members, siblings of current members, and alumni, respectively.  Subordinate applications are generally considered in the order filed; however, we reserve the right to diversify admissions based on enrollee age and gender.  Parent interviews are not required and enrollee children are not required to come in for a play date.

## Applications

The application fee is $45.00.  Applications are provided at the conclusion of the onsite tour and considered filed on the date the application fee is paid. 


## Communication

After your application if filed, your point of contact will be the Admissions Coordinator. We typically confirm Fall Session admissions in March.

Due to the high volume of applications, we generally do not notify denied applicants; however, pending applicants are welcome to contact the school to check their status.  Based on our waiting list, applicants can often determine session availability and the likelihood of desired enrollment.

## Summer School

We offer two sessions of summer school.  Summer session enrollment is generally lighter relative to regular sessions.  If your incoming child meets the age requirement, Summer School is a great way to acclimate them to the school, teachers and with the added benefit of a smaller class size.  For summer session dates, please contact the Admissions Office.

## Requirements upon Admission

Upon admission, the child is considered enrolled when the Admissions Coordinator has received the following completed forms and they are subsequently approved by the Admissions Director:

1.    Recent (within the last 12 months) medical examination form for the enrollee child.
2.    Recent (within the last 12 months) tuberculosis test for the enrollee child and for the corresponding working parent(s) or other working adult(s).
3.    Child history and family environment questionnaire.
4.    State-required disclosure forms will be provided by Laurel Hill.
5.    Payment of registration fee.
6.    Payment of first and last monthâ€™s tuition.
